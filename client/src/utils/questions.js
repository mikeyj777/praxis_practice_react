    subject: "biology",
    question: "What is the key difference between a hypothesis and a scientific theory?",
    answer: "A hypothesis is a testable prediction based on observations, while a scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of natural phenomena supported by multiple lines of evidence and testing.",
    difficulty: 3,
    topic: "nature-of-science"
  },
  {
    subject: "biology",
    question: "Explain the role of mitochondria in cellular respiration.",
    answer: "Mitochondria are the cellular powerhouses where most ATP is produced through oxidative phosphorylation, using electron transport chains to convert energy from glucose breakdown into ATP.",
    difficulty: 3,
    topic: "cell-biology"
  },
  {
    subject: "biology",
    question: "How does natural selection contribute to antibiotic resistance in bacteria?",
    answer: "When bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, individuals with random mutations conferring resistance survive and reproduce, passing these genes to offspring, leading to a resistant population over time.",
    difficulty: 4,
    topic: "genetics"
  },
  {
    subject: "biology",
    question: "Compare the key characteristics of plants and fungi.",
    answer: "Plants are autotrophs with cell walls made of cellulose and can photosynthesize, while fungi are heterotrophs with cell walls made of chitin and obtain nutrients through absorption.",
    difficulty: 3,
    topic: "diversity"
  },
  {
    subject: "biology",
    question: "What is the role of decomposers in an ecosystem?",
    answer: "Decomposers break down dead organic matter, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem and making them available for producers to use again.",
    difficulty: 2,
    topic: "ecology"
  },
  {
    subject: "biology",
    question: "How has CRISPR technology impacted genetic research and potential medical treatments?",
    answer: "CRISPR allows precise gene editing, enabling researchers to modify DNA sequences for studying gene function, developing disease treatments, and potentially correcting genetic disorders.",
    difficulty: 4,
    topic: "science-tech"
